## Better than Visual Studio


I actually quite liked VSCode to begin with but then, maybe because I put in too many plugins I stopped liking it. So many pop ups getting in the way of my code. Usually not helpful. 

On the other hand Neovim gives me the assistance where I might need it and provides lots of keyboard tricks which I miss if I edit text in anything else.

Still have to touch the mouse from time to time but I can do so much with just the keyboard. So much more efficient.


Every now and then I find another tip on YouTube to allow me to get even more productivity out of Neovim. An easier way to move around the page or a way to eaily put something like quotation marks, brackets or whatever I need around a set of words. I like how I can delete a whole bunch of text inside a pair of html tags or a pair of parentheses. Easy peasy and no mouse action required for the job.

I'm not the only one who loves using Neovim for coding and other text editing.
