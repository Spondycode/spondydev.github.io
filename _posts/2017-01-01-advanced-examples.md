## Neovim is the Bees Knees

## Better than Visual Studio


I actually quite liked VSCode to begin with but then, maybe because I put in too many plugins I stopped liking it. So many pop ups getting in the way of my code. Usually not helpful. 

On the other hand Neovim gives me the assistance where I might need it and provides lots of keyboard tricks whic I miss if I edit text in anything else. 




## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_C0A5zX-iqM" %}
